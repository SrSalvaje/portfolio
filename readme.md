#Udacity Front-End Web Development Scolarship

This website represents the second project of the course, it is a template on which 
I plan to build a live  porfolio site to showcase all of the course projects as well 
as my CV and professional portfolio.

It was made from scratch without using any libraries as a way to familiarize myself 
with CSS3 and HTML5. The off-screen Hamburger menu code is based on the tutorial 
of [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_off-canvas.asp) but was adapted and changed by me.

The background gradient is called "sky", the code was made by [@_ighosh](https://twitter.com/_ighosh) for the community and was taken from his [website](https://uigradients.com/#Sky).

The images are hosted on Dropbox using the [path to the file itself](https://ryanmo.co/2013/11/03/dropboxsharedlinks/) instead of the preview path.
